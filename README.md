#To-Do List
##Description
This was the final project for the JavaScript: JSON and Ajax class offered by the Oâ€™Reilly
School of Technology. The application is a to-do list application that utilizes Local
Storage so the to-do items are persistent. It also makes use of Geolocation to display
a marker on a Google Map indicating where a to-do item was added. Modernizr is used to
determine if the web browser supports Local Storage and Geolocation. If they are not,
Modernizr loads alternative function definitions so the application continues to run,
but with reduced functionality.
##Installation
In order to run the application from disk, copy all the files to a folder and open the
todo.html file with either Firefox or Safari. Chrome cannot be used to run it locally
because it does not present the user with an option to allow location services for
local files like Firefox and Chrome do. In order to use Chrome, the files need to be
loaded from a web server.
